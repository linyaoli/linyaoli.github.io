# Ni Hao!

Thanks for reading.

Before you click any link in the sidebar, please know this is not a blog.
The reason I'm maintaining this site is to share
the knowledge which I believe are valuable, and just in case, might be
valuable for others. Occasionally I would share some documents here when I've
read good books, figured out interesting problems and algorithms. However
you may find these notes are unorganized, and indeed they are --
it is the consequence of my laziness.

May the force be with you.
