# Shazam

The Shazam algorithm uses a technique called acoustic fingerprinting to identify songs. Key steps in how it works:

1. Audio sampling: When a user wants to identify a song, Shazam records a short audio sample (up to 15 seconds) using the device's microphone[1][4].
2. Spectrogram creation: The audio sample is converted into a spectrogram, which is a visual representation of the frequencies present in the audio over time[3][4].
3. Peak extraction: The algorithm identifies the strongest frequency peaks in the spectrogram. These peaks represent the most prominent and distinctive parts of the audio[1][3].
4. Fingerprint generation: The algorithm creates a unique "fingerprint" of the audio by pairing these peak points and hashing them. This process is called combinatorial hashing[1][2].
5. Database matching: The generated fingerprint is compared against a large database of pre-computed fingerprints from millions of songs[1][4].
6. Identification: If a match is found in the database, Shazam returns the song information to the user[4].

Key features that make the Shazam algorithm effective:

- Noise resistance: It can identify songs even in noisy environments or with low-quality audio[1].
- Scalability: The algorithm is designed to quickly search through millions of tracks[1].
- Efficiency: It can perform identifications in just a few seconds[1].
- Robustness: It can recognize songs despite variations in playback speed, pitch, or background noise[3].

The algorithm's ability to create unique, compact fingerprints from audio samples and efficiently match them against a large database is what enables Shazam to quickly and accurately identify songs in various conditions[1][2][3].
